# Privacy Policy
Unfortunately I am a single developer with no knowledge of legal writing. The good news is that I will not pretend and use a "Privacy Policy Generator" and you will not have to pretend to have read the document. The privacy policy of the app is as follows:

* No personal information is requested by the app. It only reads issue contents.
* There is no communication with any web services or databases outside the official Jira/Atlassian services.
* Issues will only be modified based on the user input. The app will not modify any data unless provoked.

# Security Statement
The security of the app is ensured by having no awareness of user credentials or personal information. Any other information is forgotten as soon as possible. Only app configuration settings (user preferences) are stored using Atlassian services, without the use of third-party databases.
