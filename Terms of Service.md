# Terms of Service
Unfortunately I am a single developer with no knowledge of legal writing. The good news is that I will not pretend and use a "ToS Generator" and you will not have to pretend to have read the document. The terms of service for the app are as follows:

* The app is provided as-is. Issues can be [reported](../../issues) and features can be [requested](../../discussions), but private or prioritized support cannot be demanded.
* You will not be rewarded for feature requests that have been implemented.
* Payments cannot be refunded.
* In rare cases where actions performed by the app were not desired, you will not receive payments for the "damages".
* Images and icons provided by the app are property of the creator and must not be copied or redistributed.
