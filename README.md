# ![Icon](../../raw/main/assets/icon-x64.png) Higher/Lower Issue Prioritizer

### How To Use
Start by going to the Project Settings and finding the dedicated app settings page. Each section has a thorough explanation of the fields below, to help you set them correctly. After pressing the save button, you should see a green check mark appear next to the button if all fields are valid.

After configuring the app, you can start using it. After opening an issue, click the Start button to start prioritizing the issue. This button is located amongst the other issue fields on the right. You will be prompted with an issue. Click Higher if the selected issue is more important than the shown issue. Similarly, click Lower if the selected issue is less important than the shown issue.

After a handful of prompts, the issue will be moved into position and the configured action (from the app settings) will be performed. Also the issue will automatically be assigned to a sprint if needed.
