# Privacy Policy

Unfortunately I am a single developer with no knowledge of legal writing. The good news is that I will not pretend and use a "Privacy Policy Generator" and you will not have to pretend to have read the document. The privacy policy of the app is as follows:

* No personal information is requested by the app. It only reads issue contents.
* There is no communication with any web services or databases outside the official Jira/Atlassian services.
* Issues will only be modified based on the user input. The app will not modify any data unless provoked.
